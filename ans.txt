EduVerseJr is an online education platform providing Math and Coding classes for grades 5 to 10. We serve students in the US, Australia, UK, Singapore, Dubai, and Canada. To answer your questions:

1)We offer both Math and Coding. Since the Math curriculum varies greatly, we need to simplify it into a single, unified content structure that works across all countries—similar to how we handle Coding. Please analyze this and suggest a better content strategy for both.

2)We prefer a single-page layout with expandable sections.

3)The target audience is parents who are browsing quickly.

4)I will leave the final decision on the best approach to you.if you have any questions pls ask beforer proces sand  Please provide the details so we can discuss further
