WEBSITE CONTENT ANALYSIS SUMMARY
============================================================

WHAT I FOUND:

1. WEBSITE DESIGN - FULLY BUILT
   - React/Vite based beGalileo clone
   - 15+ sections all working
   - Blue gradient theme
   - Fully responsive

2. CURRENT WEBSITE CONTENT - VERY BRIEF
   - Short marketing text in each section
   - Generic feature descriptions
   - 3 English programs listed
   - 3 Coding programs listed
   - 12 FAQ items
   - Sample pricing plans

3. PDF CONTENT - VERY EXTENSIVE

   Maths folder has 15 PDFs:
   - US Common Core curriculum
   - UK curriculum
   - Canadian curriculum
   - Australian curriculum
   - Singapore curriculum
   - UAE curriculum
   - Multiple pedagogical approach documents

   Coding folder has 3 PDFs:
   - Coding Curriculum Introduction
   - Course Cards
   - Detailed Grades 5-8 curriculum

============================================================
THE PROBLEM:

Your PDFs have 100+ pages of detailed curriculum content.
Your website currently has only brief placeholder text.

We need to decide what curriculum details should go on
the website and what should be shortened.

============================================================
QUESTIONS I NEED ANSWERED:

Q1: Which curriculum details are MOST IMPORTANT to show?
    - All countries? Just one?
    - Detailed topics or just high-level overview?

Q2: Website structure - which do you prefer?
    - Single page with expandable sections
    - Multiple pages with navigation menu

Q3: Who is your main audience?
    - Parents browsing quickly
    - Educators needing curriculum details
    - Both equally

Q4: From the PDFs what MUST be on the main landing page?
    What can be on secondary pages or downloads?

============================================================
NEXT STEPS:

1. Read this file carefully
2. Answer the 4 questions above
3. Tell me your answers
4. I will then create a content plan for you
